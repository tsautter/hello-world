# hello-world
hello world for me who doesn't know anything about programming
//After 12 years of doing environmental consulting I've come to realize I absolutely hate it.  Actually I've known that pretty much the whole time but finally got to a point where I realized I needed to do some serious work to change my field.  So here I am.  I want to learn programming languages and learn how to develop software and/or apps, and maybe games.  I'm not super interested in web development, but I will probably dabble in that along the way.  I've been using computers since the early 90s, am good at trouble shooting stuff and fixing things, but I've never taken a formal CS class. I regret going into geology and not CS.  I am confident that I can get good at programming, since my mind tends to see things in a similar manner.  I also want to make a lot more money than I currently am.  I have a family to support, and can't afford/don't have the time to go back to college and become an engineer (another career path that would have been a way better choice than geology).  So hello github, I look forward to learning a ton of stuff!
